# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch

The purpose of this repo is three folds:
- 1) Help myself to understand the learning algorithms better by coding and theoratical knowledge writing;
- 2) For better future retrival of these basic yet important knowledge;
- 3) Hopefully, could be helpful for someone who need it.

## Perceptron and Neural network


## Tree-based algorithms


## Unsupervised algorithms
